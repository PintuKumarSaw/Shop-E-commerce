# 🛍️ Shop E-Commerce

**Shop E-Commerce** is a modern, fully responsive online shopping web application built with **React (Vite)**.  
The project focuses on delivering a smooth and engaging shopping experience for users, complete with product browsing, detailed item views, and a fully functional cart system.

This e-commerce site demonstrates the fundamentals of React-based web development — from dynamic UI rendering to state management using React Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`. It features product listing pages where users can view images, names, and prices, as well as add or remove items from their cart in real-time. The cart automatically calculates the total price, giving users an intuitive, real-world e-commerce experience.

Designed with **modern aesthetics and responsiveness**, the website adapts seamlessly across all screen sizes — from mobile to desktop — ensuring accessibility for every user. The styling is powered by **CSS3** and **Bootstrap**, combined with custom layouts for a sleek look and feel. Built using **Vite**, it ensures lightning-fast builds and hot-reload performance during development.

This project serves as an excellent portfolio piece for demonstrating proficiency in **React**, **frontend design**, and **component-based architecture**. It’s ideal for beginners and professionals alike who want to showcase their web development and UI design skills in a professional, real-world context.
